<h3>Lesson 16 Quiz</h3>
- The VPN router installed in the central office or hub needs to be a powerful machine 
  capable of aggregating high traffic volumes. This VPN router is also known as a VPN headend.
  VPN headends would typically install in groups for load balancing and fault tolerance.

- Wide area network (WAN) technologies support data communications over greater distances than LANs. 
  Long-distance communications usually involve the use of public networks. Public networks are owned 
  by telecommunications (telco) companies and provide WAN services to businesses and households.

- Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a technology that can transfer data over voice-grade telephone lines,
  often referred to as the local loop.

- Ethernet over Copper uses DSL variants such as single-pair high-speed DSL (SHDSL) and very high-speed DSL (VDSL)
  to overcome the usual distance limitations of copper Ethernet. This does not support the same speeds as LAN 
  Ethernet (more typically 2-10 Mbps), but the organization can combine multiple pairs for higher bandwidth. 

- Most modern remote network access solutions use Internet access infrastructure and set up a secure tunnel for 
  private communications through the internet. This is known as a virtual private network (VPN).

- The major obstacle to providing WAN access that can approach LAN performance is bandwidth in the last mile. 
  The most expensive solution is Fiber to the Premises (FTTP).

- A remote access VPN refers to extending local network access over an intermediate public network so that a remote computer can join the local network.
   * The network engineer can also deploy a VPN in a site-to-site model to connect two or more private networks. The configuration of a site-to-site VPN is to operate automatically.
   * A site-to-site VPN that involves more than two sites connects the remote sites (or spokes) to a headquarters site (hub) by using static tunnels configured between the hub and each spoke. This is referred to as a hub and spoke topology.
   * This VPN router is also known as a VPN headend. VPN headends would typically install in groups for load balancing and fault tolerance.  

- A dynamic multipoint VPN (DMVPN) allows VPNs to be set up dynamically according to traffic requirements and demand.

- A site-to-site VPN that involves more than two sites connects the remote sites (or spokes) to a headquarters site (hub) by using static tunnels configured between the hub and each spoke. This is referred to as a hub and spoke topology.

- The term enterprise WAN describes a WAN operated and controlled by a single organization.

<h3>Lesson 17 Quiz</h3>
- A closed-circuit alarm is more secure because cutting the circuit can defeat an open-circuit alarm. 
  The security consultant can use this type of system for tamper detection.

- An incident response plan sets out the procedures, tools, methods of communication, and guidelines for dealing with security incidents.

- An industrial control system (ICS) provides mechanisms for workflow and process automation. An ICS controls machinery used in critical 
  infrastructures, like power suppliers, water suppliers, health services, telecommunications, and national security services.

- An asset tag shows the ID of a device or component and links it to an inventory management database. Radio Frequency ID (RFID) asset 
  tracking tags allow electronic surveillance of managed assets and are detectable at entry/exit points to prevent theft.

- Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) refers to a low-power version of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) or 4G cellular standard. The signal occupies 
  less bandwidth than regular cellular. This means that data rates are limited (20-100 kbps), but most sensors send small packets with
  low latency rather than making large data transfers.

- A security camera is either fixed or operated using Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) controls. Different cameras suit different purposes. A fixed,
  narrow focal length camera positioned on the doorway is adequate to record images of individuals entering through an access control vestibule.

- Z-Wave is a wireless communications protocol used primarily for home automation and creates a mesh network topology. The Z-Wave Alliance operates
  a device and software certification program.

- A floor plan is a detailed diagram of wiring and port locations. Physically accurate floor plans are hard to design and are likely to require the
  help of an architect or graphics professional.  

- When a server or appliance is disposed of by resale, gift, or recycling, there is risk that software licenses could be misused or valuable 
  configuration information leaked to an attacker. Invoking the built-in factory reset routine to wipe any custom configuration settings or 
  modifications when decommissioning a server, switch, router, firewall, or printer can mitigate these risks.
  
- A rack system is a specially configured steel shelving system for patch panels, switches and routers, and server devices. Racks are standard widths
  and can fit appliances using standard height multiples of 1.75" called units (U).   

- A motion-based alarm is an alarm linked to a detector triggered by movement within a relatively large area, such as a room. The sensors in these 
  detectors are either microwave radio reflection (similar to radar) or passive infrared (PIR), which detect moving heat sources.  

- A physical access control system (PACS) is a network of monitored locks, intruder alarms, and video surveillance cameras.

- A documented change management process minimizes the risk of unscheduled downtime by implementing changes in a planned and controlled way.

- LTE Machine Type Communication (LTE-M) is a low-power system but supports higher bandwidth (up to about 1 Mbps).

- A wiring diagram (or pin-out) shows detailed information about the termination of twisted pairs in an RJ-45 or RJ-48C jack or Insulation Displacement Connector (IDC).
<h2>Lab: Configure Remote Access</h2>
 *** configure an IPSec policy that requires a client (PC10) to establish a secure connection with a server (MS10). IPsec policies can be enabled to encrypt connections between systems, 
    whether on an internal LAN or a VPN connection. The principle is the same in both cases. A zero-trust model ensures that all communications between servers or between servers and clients
    is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted. ***

 'certsrv'  
 'certlm.msc' 
 
 An https certificate encrypts connections at the transport layer (Transport Control Protocol or User Datagram Protocol). 

- IPSec requires that the endpoints be configured with matching policies. The client has not been configured with an IPSec policy.
<h2>Lab: Develop Network Documentation</h2>
***  use various network and system tools to document hostnames, IP address configurations, DNS resource records, DHCP reservations, 
   and other information for network hosts. You will also document configuration management information for Windows networks.  ***

   $ nmap -sn 10.1.24.254   (in the example)

   nslookup = dns server name, Host name, IP address
