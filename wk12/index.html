<h3>Lab: Backup and Restore Network Device Configuration</h3>
In this lab you will backup the configuration of the pfSense router. You will also backup the configuration of a Windows and a Linux web server.

The configuration of network devices can be quite complex. Often there are multiple network adapters and each may have its own IP address settings, 
firewall rules, DHCP scopes, and other information. Backing up network device configurations is as least as important as system backups on servers.

The one hour requirement is an example of which of the following disaster recovery values? mttr, mtbf, RTO, rpo
        -- Recovery Time Objective -- RTO

Uptime values may be used to satisfy service level agreements or troubleshoot configuration issues. Uptime can be gathered from 
logs (when system startup, shutdown, or restart information is logged) or via tools such as Task Manager. In Linux type uptime or top to see the system's uptime.

Backups ensure that data is not lost and backups help get services back up more quickly

RTO Recovery Time Objective = time service MUST be restored
