<h3>Lesson 18 Quiz</h3>
- Cisco's proprietary Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) allows multiple physical routers to serve as a single default gateway for a subnet. 
    Each router must have an interface connected to the subnet, with its own unique MAC address and IP address.

- Layer 7 switch —As web applications have become more complex, modern load balancers need to make forwarding decisions based on application-level data. 
    This requires more complex logic, but the processing power of modern appliances is sufficient.

- An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) will provide a temporary power source in the event of a blackout. UPS runtime may range from a few minutes for a desktop-rated model to hours for an enterprise system.

- Environmental controls mitigate the loss of availability through mechanical issues with equipment, such as overheating. Building control systems maintain an optimum working environment for different parts
   of the building. The acronym HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) describes these services.

- A virtual IP or shared or floating address uses a public IP to access the service shared between the two instances in the cluster, unlike load balancing with a single appliance. This allows the network 
  specialist to provision two load balancer appliances. If one fails, the other can still handle client connections.   

- A load balancer can be deployed as a hardware appliance or software instance to distribute client requests across server nodes in a farm or pool. A network engineer can also use a load balancer in any situation with multiple servers providing the same function.
        - A virtual IP or shared or floating address uses a public IP to access the service shared between the two instances in the cluster, unlike load balancing with a single appliance. This allows the network specialist to provision two load balancer appliances.
        - Multipathing means that a network node has more than one physical link to another node.
        - A hot standby router monitors the status of the active router and takes over the role if the active router becomes unavailable, also triggering the selection of a new standby router from the remaining routers in the group.

- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) represents the expected lifetime of a product. The calculation for MTBF is the total operational time divided by the number of failures.
        - Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) expresses a similar metric as MTBF, however, for non-repairable components.
        - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) measures the time to correct a fault and restore the system to full operation.
        - A power distribution unit has circuitry to “clean” the power signal, provides protection against spikes, surges, and brownouts, and can integrate with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

- A power distribution unit (PDU) has circuitry to "clean" the power signal. It also provides protection against spikes, surges, and brownouts and can integrate with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

- Layer 4 switch—Basic load balancers make forwarding decisions on IP address and TCP/UDP header values, working at the transport layer of the OSI model.
        - Layer 7 switch (content switch)—As web applications have become more complex, modern load balancers need to make forwarding decisions based on application-level data

- Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) measures the time to correct a fault and restore the system to full operation. This can also include the mean time to replace or recover. MTTR is the total number of hours of unplanned maintenance divided by the number of failure incidents.
        - Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) expresses a similar metric as MTBF, however, for non-repairable components.
        - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) represents the expected lifetime of a product. The calculation for MTBF is the total operational time divided by the number of failures.

<h3>Lesson 19 Quiz</h3>


<h3>Lab: Backup and Restore Network Device Configuration</h3>
In this lab you will backup the configuration of the pfSense router. You will also backup the configuration of a Windows and a Linux web server.

The configuration of network devices can be quite complex. Often there are multiple network adapters and each may have its own IP address settings, 
firewall rules, DHCP scopes, and other information. Backing up network device configurations is as least as important as system backups on servers.

The one hour requirement is an example of which of the following disaster recovery values? mttr, mtbf, RTO, rpo
        -- Recovery Time Objective -- RTO

Uptime values may be used to satisfy service level agreements or troubleshoot configuration issues. Uptime can be gathered from 
logs (when system startup, shutdown, or restart information is logged) or via tools such as Task Manager. In Linux type uptime or top to see the system's uptime.

Backups ensure that data is not lost and backups help get services back up more quickly

RTO Recovery Time Objective = time service MUST be restored
<h3>Lab: Configure Port Security</h3>
In this lab you will configure and test firewall settings for a router and a server.

In this example, you specified a particular IP address to be filtered by the router. You could have specified an entire subnet. It can be useful to isolate
 traffic within a LAN between departments or environments such as staging, dev, and production.

This should fail. That indicates that there is no route to the destination or that the route is blocked by a firewall rule. Such a test helps narrow the 
 scope of the problem for troubleshooting.  

Recall that a firewall applies rules to traffic that either permit or deny certain types of traffic through certain interfaces. Network Address Translation (NAT)
does not filter traffic, but rather substitutes public and private IP addresses to maximize the use of the limited number of IPv4 addresses and to obscure the 
IP address structure of the internal network.
<h3>Lab: Analyze an On-Path Attack</h3>
Security penetration testing software can generate various network attacks. In this scenario, you will use a tool named Ettercap to perform an ARP spoofing or
poisoning attack on the MS10 virtual machine. The attack will redirect packets away from the legitimate router interface to the attacker's own network interface. 
First you will document the MS10 server's MAC address. Next, you will configure the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack and packet capture. You will then examine the 
captured packets. Finally, you will confirm the attack is over by checking MAC address information on MS10.
