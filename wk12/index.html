<h3>Lab: Backup and Restore Network Device Configuration</h3>
In this lab you will backup the configuration of the pfSense router. You will also backup the configuration of a Windows and a Linux web server.

The configuration of network devices can be quite complex. Often there are multiple network adapters and each may have its own IP address settings, 
firewall rules, DHCP scopes, and other information. Backing up network device configurations is as least as important as system backups on servers.

The one hour requirement is an example of which of the following disaster recovery values? mttr, mtbf, RTO, rpo
        -- Recovery Time Objective -- RTO

Uptime values may be used to satisfy service level agreements or troubleshoot configuration issues. Uptime can be gathered from 
logs (when system startup, shutdown, or restart information is logged) or via tools such as Task Manager. In Linux type uptime or top to see the system's uptime.

Backups ensure that data is not lost and backups help get services back up more quickly

RTO Recovery Time Objective = time service MUST be restored
<h3>Lab: Configure Port Security</h3>
In this lab you will configure and test firewall settings for a router and a server.

In this example, you specified a particular IP address to be filtered by the router. You could have specified an entire subnet. It can be useful to isolate
 traffic within a LAN between departments or environments such as staging, dev, and production.

This should fail. That indicates that there is no route to the destination or that the route is blocked by a firewall rule. Such a test helps narrow the 
 scope of the problem for troubleshooting.  

Recall that a firewall applies rules to traffic that either permit or deny certain types of traffic through certain interfaces. Network Address Translation (NAT)
does not filter traffic, but rather substitutes public and private IP addresses to maximize the use of the limited number of IPv4 addresses and to obscure the 
IP address structure of the internal network.
<h3>Lab: Analyze an On-Path Attack</h3>
Security penetration testing software can generate various network attacks. In this scenario, you will use a tool named Ettercap to perform an ARP spoofing or
poisoning attack on the MS10 virtual machine. The attack will redirect packets away from the legitimate router interface to the attacker's own network interface. 
First you will document the MS10 server's MAC address. Next, you will configure the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack and packet capture. You will then examine the 
captured packets. Finally, you will confirm the attack is over by checking MAC address information on MS10.
