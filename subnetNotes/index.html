<h2>Subnetting Intro</h2>
<b>Classful addressing</b>     
    Class A: 1-126    - 255.0.0.0    -- 3 octets for Host side 
    Class B: 128-191  - 255.255.0.0  -- 2 octets for Host side
    Class C: 192-223  - 255.255.255.0 - 1 octets for Host side

    ex: <i>192.168.45.21</i> = This is a Class C address.
                -The 'Net side' address = 192.168.45
                -That leaves .21 as the 'Host side' address

Class A range = 10.0.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255
Class B range = 172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.255.255
    Loopback range = 127.0.0.0 -> 127.255.255.255 - is in Class B
    APIPA range = 169.254.0.1 -> 169.254.255.254
Class C ragne = 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.255
multicast = 224.0.0.0
Experimental = 240.0.0.0
Broadcast = 255.255.255.255

<b>IP Numbering</b>
Subnet Mask tells us what is on the Network side and what is on the Host side. 
A: 255.0.0.0     /8
B: 255.255.0.0   /16
C: 255.255.255.0 /24

--Classless uses 'sider notation' to break the addresses into smaller chunks.  
  The 'Sider Notation' references how many bits are on the Network side of the address
    Classless can have additional sider notation
           class A: /8  |  /09  /10  /11  /12  /13  /14  /15  /16
           class B: /16 |  /17  /18  /19  /20  /21  /22  /23  /24
           class C: /24 |  /25  /26  /27  /28  /29  /30  /31  /32
                          (128)(192)(224)(240)(248)(252)(254)(255) = subnet mask
                           ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___
                           128   64   32   16   8    4    2    1    = # of Hosts 

                            2    4    8    16   32   64  128  256   = # of Subnets

  ex: using /26 network we have 4 Subnets, 64 TOTAL Hosts (Usable Hosts = 62) per subnet, with a subnet mask of 192 
            -we you will have subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 
            -we subtract 2 (-2) from the Total Hosts to get the Usable Hosts; remember 1st address is 'Network ID' and Last address is 'Broadcast'
 
 Remeber there are 4 octets for an address & Class B has 2 octets (Class A has 3 HOST octets):
       
          Class B Range                          Class C Range
 ___   ___  ___   ___  ___  ___  ___  ___ . ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___
32768 16384 8192 4096 2048 1024  512  256   128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1 


 if we use /23 network as an example it will lie in the 512 area 
   -- we know we have 128 Subnets, 512 Hosts(??) and a subnet mask of 255.255.254.0


Prof Rondeau Suggests writing out the chart first thing during testing: 

          128  192  224  240  248  252  254  255  -- Subnet Mask
          ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___
Class C:  128   64   32   16   8    4    2    1   -- Hosts /24-/32
Class B:                           ...  512  256  -- Hosts /16-/23
           2    4    8    16   32   64  128  256  -- Subnets 

ex: /19 network will have 8 subnets, 8192 Total Hosts (8190 Usable) / subnet, subnet mask of 255.255.224.0 because it is class B

<h2>Subnetting Intermediate</h2>
ex 01: 192.168.45.21 /24  -- we know that /24 is a class C network. 
    we know the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0
    -- we find the 'Network ID' by 'ANDing' the Host IP address and the Subnet Mask 
    In the above example the Network ID is: 192.168.45.0
    
    the Host information we have obtained is: Host address .21 /24, subnet mask 0, Network ID 0
      we have the full last octet for USABLE addressing. 192.168.45.1 -> 192.168.45.254 (not the host or the broadcast)

ex 02: 192.168.45.21 /25 -- 1 extra bit changes everything  
   Subnet Mask is now 255.255.255.128  (in the previous example there are 256 addresses on 1 subnet, now 128 addresses each on 2 subnets [256 total still])  
     will have 2 subnets 0-127 & 128-255 (totals)
       usable subnet addressess: 1->126 & 129->254

ex 03: 192.168.45.21 /26 -- changed again
    Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.192  --- ANDing it up again (no overlap, still)
    192.168.45.0 Network ID - with 4 subnets of 64 Total Hosts per Subnet
       1st 192.168.45.0   -> .63
       2nd 192.168.45.64  -> .127
       3rd 192.168.45.128 -> .191
       4th 192.168.45.192 -> .255
  Usable addressess will be -2 per subnet for ID and broadcast.

ex 04:  192.168.45.21 /30 -- big subnet mask increase 
   subnet Mask: 255.255.255.252 -- ANDing between 21 & 252   
     resulting Network ID = 192.168.45.20  == the Network ID for the Subnet that address in ex: 04 belongs to.
      there will be 64 Subnets with 4 Total Hosts each (2 usable hosts each?)

ex 05:  192.168.45.101 /28
      subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240  -- ANDing 101 & 240
      there will be 16 subnets with 16 hosts on each. 
      the Network ID will be: 192.168.45.96 -- host 101 is a member of Network .96
        to find the subnet we divide the host amount by the host id -- this will give the subnet group

ex 06:  192.168.45.21 /23  -- Class B address
   subnet mask: 255.255.254.0    
    there will be 128 subnets with 512 Host addressess per subnet breakdown.
     the Network ID will be: 192.168.44.0
  *since there are 512 hosts then it will be larger than 1 octet (octet is only 256 [0-255])
    and you will have to use to ranges, ex: 192.168.45.0->255 + 192.168.46.0->255

<h2>Variable Length Subnetting</h2>
    ex 01: Lab has 50 computers, office has 10 computers, HR office has 10 computers
            Lab:     50 - needs 50 hosts - that will be /26 
            Office:  10 - this will be /28
            HR:      6 - this will be /29
    we are starting the Network ID @ 192.168.45.0 our /26 network has 64 hosts [0 - 64] per subnet. we alot the first subnet [0-63]
                                     192.168.45.64 starts our /28 network and we alot 16 hosts for that subnet range giving us 63 + 16 [79]
                                     192.168.45.80 starts the /29 network and there are 8 hosts for that range 80-87 will be our last 8 addressess.
