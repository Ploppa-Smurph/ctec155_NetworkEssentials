<h2>Lesson 20 - Practice Quiz</h2>
- A third party hosts the hosted private model for the exclusive use of the organization. This is more secure and can guarantee a better level of performance, but it is correspondingly more expensive.

- The spine layer comprises a backbone of top-tier switches. While this is described as a backbone, the spine switches are not linked to one another.

- Internal switches create a bridge that is usable only by VMs on the host and the host itself. This type of switch does not permit access to the wider physical network.

- With the public or multitenant model, the businesses can use subscriptions or pay-as-you-go financing while at the same time providing lower-tier services free of charge.

- The principal innovation of SDN is to insert a control layer between the application layer and the infrastructure layer. The functions of the control plane are implemented by a virtual device referred to as the SDN controller.

- External switches bind to the host's NIC to allow the VM to communicate on the physical network.

- Fibre Channel is in the T11 ANSI standard. The deliberate British spelling "fibre" distinguishes the standard from fiber optic cabling, which it often uses but does not rely on.
    - Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) delivers Fibre Channel packets over Ethernet cabling and switches.

- Private switches create a switch that is usable only by the VMs. They cannot use the switch to communicate with the host.

- The application layer applies the business logic to decide how to prioritize traffic and secure data and where the data should switch.

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) quickly provides rentable IT resources such as servers, load balancers, and storage area network (SAN) components.

- In a private cloud model, the cloud infrastructure is entirely private to and owned by the organization. In this case, there is likely to be one business unit dedicated to managing the cloud while other business units use it.

- The infrastructure layer contains devices (physical or virtual) that handle the actual forwarding (switching and routing) of traffic and imposition of ACLs and other policy configurations for security.

- In a community cloud model, several organizations share the costs of either a hosted private or fully private cloud. This can pool resources for common concerns, like standardization and security policies.

- The leaf layer contains access switches. Each access switch connects to every spine switch in a full mesh topology. The access switches never have direct connections to one another.
