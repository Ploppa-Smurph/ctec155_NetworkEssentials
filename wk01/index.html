        <h2>Comparing OSI Model Network Functions</h2>
        OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model uses 7 functional layers to divide Network Technology.

        Networks are built on standards and models that describe how devices and protocols interconnect. The OSI Model breaks data communication process into
            discrete layers. Learning the layers and the functions of devices and protocols working at each layer will help implement and troubleshoot networks. 

        7 Layers of the OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection): <b>All People Seem To Need Data Processing</b>
              
                7} Application -- DNS is resolving at this layer

                6} Presentation -- Encrypted communication between a client and web server

                5} Session -- the Session is brought up, managed, and maintained

                4} Transport -- once the session is open we gurantee reliable delivery of data (TCP)

                3} Network -- Addressing and Routing of Data -- allows us to send information to remote networks

                2} Data Link -- allows for use of the local network (mac address present on our data)

                1} Physical -- 

            Not all network systems implement layers using this structure they implement each task in some way. The OSI model is not a standard / specification, it is a functional model
             for designing network protocols, software, and applicances for troubleshooting networks     

        --video with example of Alice using Amazon's web servers to purchase her favorite products.
            When Alice opens the web browser she is starting layer 7 == the Application

            TCP helps reassemble data in the correct order once it is received (Transmission Control Protocol).

    <h3>Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation</h3>        
        Network Protocol has 2 primary functions: 
            Addressing: describing where data should go.
            Encapsulation: how data should be packaged for transmission. each layer is encapsulated and it's data is sent with a header.

        A network will use many different protocols operating at different layers of the OSI. At each layer in order for 2 nodes to communicate they must be running the same protocol.
         This communication between nodes at the same layer is described as '<i>same layer interaction</i>'.
         Each layer provides services for the layer above and uses the services of the layer below -- this is refered to as '<i>adjacent layer interaction</i>'.

         <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/wmx-api-production/courses/17591/images/4836-1622126842748-n10-008_encapsulation_decapsulation.png" style="width:700px;height:600px;">

        As a message is sent from one node to another it travels down the stack on the sending node until it reaches the receiving node.

        ex: "For example, on the sending node, data is generated by an application, such as the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which will include its own application header. 
             At the transport layer, a Transport Control Protocol (TCP) header is added to this application data. At the network layer, the TCP segment is wrapped in an Internet Protocol (IP) header.
              The IP packet is encapsulated in an Ethernet frame at the data link layer, then the stream of bits making up the frame is transmitted over the network at the physical layer as a modulated electrical signal.

            The receiving node performs the reverse process, referred to as decapsulation. It receives the stream of bits arriving at the physical layer and decodes an Ethernet frame.
             It extracts the IP packet from this frame and resolves the information in the IP header, then does the same for the TCP and application headers, eventually extracting the HTTP application data for processing by a software program,
             such as a web browser or web server."

    <h2>Layer 1 - Physical</h2>
        responsible for transmission and receipt of the data: can be cabled or wireless.

        Physical Layer specifies the following:
         - Physical Topology - layout of nodes and links 

         - Physical Interface - mechanical specifications for the network medium (ie: cable specs or radio transceiver specs)

         - the process of transmitting and receiving over the network medium including modulation schemes and timing synchronization.

    Devices that operate at the Physical layer include:
        -Transceiver - the part of a network interface that sends and receives signals over network media
        -Repeater - device that amplifies an electric signal to extend maximum allowable distance
        -Hub - multi-port repeater, deployed as the central point of cennection for nodes 
        -Media Converter - converts one media signaling type to another 
        -Modem - device that performs signal modulation and demodulation, such as sending digital data over an analog line.   
    <h2>Layer 2 - Data Link</h2>
        responsible for transferring data between nodes on the same logical segment.
    
    Devices that operate at the data link layer include: 
        -Network Adapter / NIC (Network Interface Card) - allows communication over the network by assembling and disassembling 'frames'.  
        -Bridge - intermediate system that joins physical network segments while minimizing performance reduction of have more nodes. 
                  A bridge has multiple ports, each functions as a network interface.  
        -Switch - advanced type of bridge with many ports. Switch creates links between large numbers of nodes more efficiently          
        -WAP(Wireless Access Point) - allows nodes with wireless network cards to communicate and create a bridge between wireless networks and wired ones. 
    <h2>Layer 3 - Network</h2>    
        responsible for moving data around a network of networks (ie: the internet). The data link layer is capable of moving data using hardware addressess in a single segment;
          the Network layer can move data around the internetwork.
    
    Device that operates at the Network Layer: 
        -Router - 

        It is important for traffic passing between networks to be filtered. A basic firewall operates at layer 3 to enforce an ACL (Access Control List).
          The network ACL contains the addressess and types of traffic that are permitted or blocked.
    <h2>Layer 4 - Transport</h2>
       The first 3 layers are concerned with moving 'frames' and 'datagrams' between nodes and networks. At the transport layer 
         (aka End-to-End or Host-to-Host layer) the content of the packets becomes significant.
         
    Devices working at the Transport Layer include advanced firewalls and IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems).
    <h2>Upper Layers</h2>
       the upper layers are less clearly associated with distinct real-world protocols. 
    <h3>Layer 5 - Session</h3>
        allows the exchange of multiple messages between client and server. This exchange of messages is called a 'session', or dialog.
          The session layer (layer 5) establishes dialog, manages data transfer, and ends ('tears down') the session.        
    <h3>Layer 6 - Presentation</h3>
        transforms the data between the format required for the network and the format required for the application. 
            ex: layer 6 is where character set conversion (ASCII to Unicode) takes place.
    <h3>Layer 7 - Application</h3>
        the top of the OSI Stack. This layer does not encapsulate any other protocol, nor does it provide services to any protocol.
          Application layer protocols provide interface for software programs on the network hosts that have established a communications channel through the lower-level protocols.

        Upper-layer protocols provide most of the services that make a network useful. ie: web browsing, email, directory lookup, remote priniting and database services.

    <h1>Configure SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) Network</h1>
    <h2>SOHO Routers</h2>
        a small LAN (local area network) that relies on single integrated appliance for local and internet connectivity.
        
        routing is only one of the functions of the SOHO router.
            
        Layer 1 Function (Physical): 
              - RJ-45 Ports (labled as LAN ports).
              - Radio Antennas to transmit and receive wireless data.
              - a modem (cable / dsl) to connect to the ISP (labled WAN Port).

        Layer 2 Function (Data Link):
              - Ethernet Switch - RJ-45 jackes are connected internally by an Ethernet Switch.
              - Wireless Access Point (WAP) - the WAP is wired to the Ethernet Switch via an internal port forming a bridge between the cabled and wireless segments.
                 --At Layer 2 each host interface is identified by it's MAC (Media Access Control) address.
       
        Layer 3 Function (Network):
              - Makes forwarding decisions - moves data that needs to stay in the local network to each computer, but also distinguishes if it needs to forward information to the internetwork.
              - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - assigns unique IP address to each device connected via Ethernet or Wireless. 
                   address start with first 3 octets of the router address: 192.168.1 -- last octet can range between 0 - 254 (excluding router value).
              - SOHO's WAN interface is allocated a public IP address by the ISP. When a host on the local network tries to access a valid IP outside the LAN the router forwards the packets over the WAN.
        
        Layer 4 Transport and Security:
              - There is NO separate OSI model layer for security, instead security solutions are needed at every layer.
              - Firewalls are used to filter traffic, they can be configured to block traffic based on the destination IP address or the type of application.
              - Hosts can access the network via RJ-45 ports, but Wireless can be encrypted.
              - It is important to have a strong passphrase for the Router's Management Interface.  
    <h2>The Internet</h2>
        <b>Public Switched Telephone Network</b> -            


        <b>Internet Service Providers</b> - high bandwidth trunks connecting Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) that provide connectivity to users           


        <b>Internet Standards</b>:
            - <b>IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)</b> {iana.org} - manages allocation of IP addresses and maintenanc on top-level domain space. 
                  IANA is currently run by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)

            - <b>IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)</b> {ietf.org} - focuses on sulutions to internet problems and the adoption of new standards. 
                    IETF publishes RFCs (Request for Comments) - older RFCs are not updated, instead a new RFC is created with a new number.
                    
    <h2>Hexadecimal Notation</h2>
        Decimal is base 10. Binary is base 2. Hexadecimal is base 16 and uses numbers 0-9 and characters A-F. Each 'byte' (or 'octet') can be expressed as 2 hex digits (ex: 255 is the same as 0xFF or FF)
        
        
Decimal    Hexadecimal  Binary
    0           0        0000

    1           1        0001
