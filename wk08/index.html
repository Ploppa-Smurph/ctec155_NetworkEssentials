<h2>Lesson 12: Ensuring Network Availability</h2>

<h3>12A </h3>
<h4></h4>
Need to read and take notes on chapter 09, 11, 12, 13


<h2>Lesson 13: Explaining Common Security Concepts</h2>
<h3>13A </h3>

<h3>Assited Lab: Analyze Network Performance</h3>
    $ perfmon   = opens performance monitor
    
2 computers are on different VLAN subnets -- configure a router

    $ iftop  = network monitoring tool on the router 
        -$  sudo iftop -i eth1          == will monitor traffic on eth1 interface 
 
- robocopy  -- displays performance information 
<h3>Assited Lab: Configure Syslog</h3>
    -The line $template DynamicFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%.log" defines a template format named DynamicFile that creates a log named for the server's hostname. In this scenario, it will generate a log file named kali.log that originates from the Kali Linux server.
    -The line *.* ?DynamicFile states that all Rsyslog facilities (services and applications) of all severities (alert levels) will be sent via the template.
    -The line & ~ stops any process matching after this point


Mousepad = Kali's desktop text editor

vyos only has 'vi' installed -- not vim -- save and exit by hitting 'esc' and entering command ':wq'
<h3>Assited Lab: Configure Secure Access Channels</h3>
        --secure the SSH remote administration tool. First, you will confirm password authentication, and then you will configure security warnings. Next, you will configure key-based authentication and prevent the root user from authenticating over SSH. Finally, you will manage SSH log file

**Each time you change a configuration file, you must restart the service for the change to take effect.
<h3>Assisted Lab: Analyze Application Security Configurations</h3>
In this activity, you will use an email client to examine the effect of using unsecured protocols by intercepting messages with Wireshark.


**In a zero-trust environment, even the internal LAN is untrusted. Someone could still be running packet sniffing software and may intercept such sensitive messages.    

IMAP = TCP
DNS = UDP

** the IMAP server is unfailingly polite, and for another, the account credentials are easily discoverable. You are sniffing your own host's traffic here, but there are means for attackers to sniff the same packets. With account passwords, you must also consider the possibility of rogue administrators.
<h3>Applied Lab: Verify Service and Application Configuration</h3>
To complete this lab, perform the following tasks:

Scan network targets

Capture network traffic

Configure DHCP services

Troubleshoot name resolution

Secure SSH authentication

Configure centralized log files

Use network performance monitoring tools

<b>nmap</b> scan options:
    -(no option)	Basic scan
    -sn	Simple scan
    -sP	pin sweep scan
    -A	Extensive scan
    -O	OS scan
    --top-ports x	x number of common ports

** the lower Wireshark pane. This pane is named 
  Packet Bytes. In the lower right corner is a long string of text. Read the text carefully
<h3>Lesson 12 Quiz</h3>
- A NetFlow collector needs a high bandwidth network link and substantial storage capacity 
   because it aggregates flows from multiple exporters and a large network can generate huge volumes of flow traffic and data records.
 
- Username/password is when the client submits credentials that the SSH server verifies either against a local user database or using a network authentication server and is a valid method.
    - In public-key authentication, each remote user's public key appends to a list of keys authorized for each local account on the SSH server and is a valid method.
    - In Kerberos, the client submits a Ticket Granting Ticket, and the SSH server contacts the Ticket Granting Service to validate the credential. This is a valid method.   

- The best tool for the administrator to use is Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which is Microsoft's protocol for operating remote GUI connections to a Windows machine. RDP uses TCP port 3389.

- The administrator is blocking Telnet which is both a protocol and a terminal emulation software tool that insecurely transmits shell commands and output between a client and the remote host on port 23.

- The server supports only Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP). SNTP works over the same port as NTP, UDP port 123. A host that supports only SNTP cannot act as a time source for other hosts.

- In performance metrics, if the system memory utilization (measured as a percentage) is very high, an administrator needs to upgrade the system memory.

- The SNMP agent maintains a database called a Management Information Base (MIB) that holds statistics relating to the activity of the device, such as the number of frames per second handled by a switch.

- The ssh-keygen command creates a key pair to use to access servers. The private key stays securely on the local computer and the ssh-copy-id command copies the public key to the server

- A code 2 level alert indicates a critical level alert meaning that a fault that will require immediate remediation is likely to develop and the administrator should investigate immediately.

- Sensors can measure temperature as high temperature will make it difficult for device and rack cooling systems to dissipate heat effectively.
    -Sensors can measure humidity as more water vapor in the air risks condensation forming within a device chassis, leading to corrosion and short circuit faults.
    -Sensors can measure flooding as there may be natural or person-made flood risks from nearby watercourses and reservoirs or risks from leaking plumbing or fire suppression systems.

- The administrator was reviewing the audit log which records the use of authentication and authorization privileges, and the administrator can configure it to perform at a per-application level.

<h3>Lesson 13 Quiz</h3>
- Utilization is the amount of data traffic both sent and received or is calculated as a percentage of the available bandwidth.

- The Differentiated Services (DiffServ) framework classifies each packet passing through a layer 3 device and can use defined router policies to use packet classification to prioritize delivery.

- Since the administrator insists on secure access, the administrator will disable a simple bind in which the client must supply its distinguished name (DN) and password, but these are plaintext.
    - Since the administrator insists on secure access, the administrator will disable no authentication, which grants anonymous access to the directory, on the server.

- The administrator should test for packet loss or delay which, when excessive, can exhaust the buffer and cause noticeable audio or video problems (artifacts) for users.
    -The administrator should test for latency which is the time it takes for a transmission to reach the recipient, measured in milliseconds (ms).
    -The administrator should test for a jitter which is a variation in the delay and manifests as an inconsistent rate of packet delivery.  

- Behavioral threat research, which is a narrative commentary describing examples of attacks and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) gathered through primary research sources.

- The organization used a process assessment which involves identifying critical systems and assets that support mission essential functions.

- The validity of the certificate is guaranteed by a certificate authority (CA) and the certificate will contain information about the certificate's issuer or guarantor.
    -A digital certificate will contain information about the subject. The CA digitally signs the certificate to prove that it was issued to the subject by a particular CA.
    -Under PKI, anyone issuing public keys should obtain a digital certificate and the digital certificate is essentially a wrapper for a subject's (or end entity's) public key.

- The administrator is using TACACS+ which is a protocol used in authenticating administrative access to routers and switches and uses TCP over port 49.

- penetration testing, also known as a pen test, which uses authorized hacking techniques to discover exploitable weaknesses in the target's security systems.

- threat which is the potential for someone or something to exploit a vulnerability and breach security. A threat may be intentional or unintentional.

- A single sign-on (SSO) system allows the user to authenticate once to a local device and it authorizes them to access compatible application servers without having to enter credentials again.

- The authentication process proves that a subject is who or what it claims to be when it attempts to access a resource.

- role-based access which defines a set of organizational roles and allocates users to those roles. Under this system, only the system owner has the right to modify roles.

- Quality of Service (QoS) allows fine-grained control over traffic parameters and can reserve the required bandwidth and pre-determine statistics such as acceptable packet loss and maximum latency and jitter.
