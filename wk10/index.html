<h2>Lesson 15 Quiz Qustions and Answers</h2>
- One of the issues with WPA3, a personal mode of authentication, is group authentication because the administrator must configure the same secret on the access point and on each node that joins the network.
    - One of the issues with WPA3, a personal mode of authentication, is that there is no accountability for individual user actions as all users share the same credential.
       * Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) is a personal authentication mechanism for Wi-Fi networks introduced with WPA3 to address vulnerabilities in the WPA-PSK method.
       * Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) is another way to reference WPA3 Personal Authentication.

- The reason Wi-Fi 6 reinstates operation in the 2.4 GHz band is to support Internet of Things (IoT) device connectivity.
        * The aim for Wi-Fi 6 is to approximate 10G connection speeds (AX11000). The only use of a new 6 GHz frequency band can achieve these data rates.
        * Wi-Fi 6 uses more complex modulation and signal encoding to improve the amount of data sent per packet by about 40% over Wi-Fi 5.
        * Wi-Fi 6 can use small resource units which reduces throughput but provides more opportunities for a larger number of devices to transmit which reduces latency.       

- 802.11 uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) where clients avoid collisions by waiting until the channel is idle before sending.
        * An ACK is an acknowledgment. Under CSMA/CA, when a station receives a frame, it performs error checking. If the frame is intact, the station responds with an ACK.
        * An RTS is a Request to Send. 802.11 also defines a Virtual Carrier Sense flow control mechanism where a station broadcasts an (RTS) with the source and destination and the time required to transmit.
        * A CTS is a Clear To Send. When a station broadcasts RTS, the receiving station responds with a CTS and all other stations in range do not attempt to transmit within that period.        

- The 2.4 GHz band is better at propagating through solid surfaces, making it ideal for providing the longest signal range.
    - The 5 GHz band supports more individual channels and suffers less from congestion and interference, meaning it supports higher data rates at shorter ranges.
        * 5 GHz is less effective at penetrating solid surfaces and so does not support the maximum ranges achieved with 2.4 GHz standards.
        * The 2.4 GHz band does not support a high number of individual channels and is often congested, both with other Wi-Fi networks and other types of wireless technology.        

- The administrator should investigate signal strength, or radiofrequency attenuation because as the distance from the antenna increases, the strength of the signal decreases in accordance with the inverse-square rule.
    - The administrator should investigate interference as interference sources collectively overlay a competing background signal, referred to as noise.         

- The administrator should check the antenna placement as incorrect antenna placement could cause or exacerbate attenuation and interference problems and cause issues with the signal strength.
    - The administrator should check for antenna cable attenuation which is signal loss caused by an external antenna connected to an access point over cabling.
    - The administrator should check Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) which is the sum of transmit power, antenna cable/connector loss, and antenna gain and can affect wireless coverage.    

- Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is a format for 2G and a standard for cellular radio communications and data transfer.
    - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a format for 2G and means that each subscriber uses a code to key the modulation of their signal and the receiver uses this "key‚Äù to extract the subscriber's traffic from the radio channel.    

- Absorption is causing decibel loss. Absorption refers to the degree to which walls and windows will reduce signal strength when passing through construction materials.

- Most wireless LANs (WLANs) are based on the IEEE 802.11 standards which define the physical layer media by which data encodes into a radio carrier signal by using a modulation scheme.

- The administrator should implement Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) which provides authenticated encryption and makes replay attacks harder.

- don't worry about the screen protector 
    * Using a virtual private network (VPN) will secure the open connection with an encrypted "tunnel" between the user's computer and the VPN server.
    * Using only Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connections will secure any confidential web data the user sends.
    * Enabling Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) for use with email, VoIP, IM, and file transfer services will secure that data from anyone who may be eavesdropping on the open access point.

- A heat map shows the signal strength within a particular channel obtained in different locations graphically and shows areas with a strong signal and warnings where signal strength drops off.

- Co-channel interference (CCI) could be causing this issue. It occurs when multiple access points use the same channel, and it reduces the opportunities for devices to transmit.
    - Adjacent channel interference (ACI) could be causing this issue. It occurs when access points use different but overlapping channels and it raises noise levels.
    - Bandwidth saturation could be causing this issue. Wireless is a broadcast medium and all clients share the available bandwidth so if one client is a bandwidth hog the others may not get a reliable connection.
        * Overcapacity would not be an issue as a maximum of 30 clients per access point is the rule of thumb and in this case, there are only 25 clients per access point.    

- The administrator could use a dedicated hardware device called a wireless LAN controller to centralize the management and monitoring of the APs on the network.
    - The administrator could use a software application, which the administrator can run on a server or workstation, to centralize the management of APs.       

- The administrator can use WDS to create an extended service area (ESA). The administrator must set the APs to use the same channel, SSID, and security parameters.
    - The administrator can use WDS to bridge two separate cabled segments. When WDS is in bridge mode, the access points will not support wireless clients; they simply forward traffic between the cabled segments.    

- The wireless devices should have vertical rod antennas which receive and send signals in all directions more-or-less equally and the installer should mount them on the ceiling for the best coverage, unless the ceiling is particularly high.

- If access points are placed too closely together, a device may not properly roam from one access point to another, causing it to disassociate and reassociate too frequently.
    - A MAC spoofing disassociation attack injects management frames that spoof the MAC address of a legitimate client in a disassociation notification, disconnecting the client from the network.
    - A client or access point can use disassociation and/or deauthentication frames to notify the other party that it has ended a connection. Interference may cause a client to disassociate unexpectedly.
